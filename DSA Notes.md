Full Tree : In Full Tree every Node either points to zero Node or Two Nodes.
Perfect Tree : In the tree every level is complete.
Complete Tree : If the Tree is getting filled from left to right i.e. in a level we have values from left to right.

BST(Binary Search Tree):
For BST adding and removing a node : O(logn)
But for worst possible scenario : O(n) b ut the chance is very less so we are considering O(logn)
lookup() : O(n)
remove() : O(n)
insert() : O(n)


If my requirement is data insertion should be faster and retreival can be managed then LinkedList is better choice than BST.
Because for linkedlist insert is O(1).

### Hash Table : 
Its One Way and deterministic. Its not vice versa. Dictionary is a example of Hash table.

**Open Addressing :** ex- Linear Probing which means it'll check for the space and if its available then it'll store the value else it'll check next place.

**Separate Chaining :** Its like storing objects in the same memory. Hash Table table uses linkedlists for separate chaining.
**Hash Method** : O(1)





Big O Comparison:
